# DAOForge Smart Contract - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Overview

DAOForge is a comprehensive decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This implementation provides a complete token-based voting mechanism with proposal creation, voting, and execution capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üèõÔ∏è **DAO Governance System**
- **Token-based Voting**: Voting power is directly tied to token ownership
- **Proposal Management**: Create, vote on, and execute governance proposals
- **Member Management**: Automatic member registration and tracking based on token ownership
- **Quorum Requirements**: Configurable quorum based on total token supply (51% default)

### üí∞ **Token Economics**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 tokens
- **Voting Power**: 1 token = 1 vote
- **Minimum Requirements**: 10 tokens required to create proposals
- **Transfer System**: Seamless token transfers with automatic member status updates

### üìã **Proposal System**
- **Proposal Creation**: Members can create proposals with title, description, type, and optional target/amount
- **Voting Period**: 7-day voting window (10,080 blocks)
- **Execution Delay**: 1-day delay after voting ends (1,440 blocks)
- **Status Tracking**: Active ‚Üí Passed/Rejected status management
- **Vote Tracking**: Individual vote records with voting power and timestamps

### üó≥Ô∏è **Voting Mechanism**
- **One Vote Per Token**: Proportional voting based on token balance
- **Vote Validation**: Prevents double voting and ensures voting period compliance
- **Quorum Enforcement**: Proposals require 51% of total supply participation
- **Majority Rule**: Simple majority of votes cast determines outcome

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Smart Contract Functions**

#### **Public Functions**
- `transfer(amount, sender, recipient, memo?)` - Transfer tokens between accounts
- `create-proposal(title, description, proposal-type, target?, amount)` - Create new governance proposal
- `vote-on-proposal(proposal-id, vote-for)` - Cast vote on active proposal
- `finalize-proposal(proposal-id)` - Finalize proposal after voting period

#### **Read-Only Functions**
- `get-dao-info()` - Get DAO metadata and statistics
- `get-member-info(member)` - Get member details and statistics
- `get-balance(account)` - Get token balance for account
- `get-proposal(proposal-id)` - Get proposal details
- `get-vote(proposal-id, voter)` - Get specific vote details
- `has-voted(proposal-id, voter)` - Check if address has voted

#### **Private Functions**
- `get-voting-power(member)` - Calculate voting power from token balance
- `is-dao-member(member)` - Check if address is a DAO member
- `calculate-quorum()` - Calculate required quorum based on total supply
- `is-valid-proposal(title, amount, target?)` - Validate proposal parameters
- `is-voting-active(proposal-id)` - Check if proposal is in voting period
- `has-quorum(proposal-id)` - Check if proposal meets quorum requirements
- `proposal-passed(proposal-id)` - Determine if proposal passed (quorum + majority)

### **Data Structures**

#### **DAO Configuration**
- `dao-name`: DAO name ("DAOForge")
- `dao-description`: DAO description
- `total-supply`: Total token supply (1,000,000)
- `treasury-balance`: Treasury balance tracking
- `proposal-count`: Global proposal counter

#### **Token Management**
- `token-balances`: Principal ‚Üí token balance mapping
- `dao-members`: Member statistics and metadata

#### **Proposal System**
- `proposals`: Complete proposal data with voting results
- `proposal-votes`: Individual vote records with metadata

### **Constants & Configuration**
- `VOTING-PERIOD`: 10,080 blocks (7 days)
- `EXECUTION-DELAY`: 1,440 blocks (1 day)
- `MINIMUM-QUORUM`: 100 tokens minimum
- `QUORUM-PERCENTAGE`: 51% of total supply

### **Error Handling**
Comprehensive error codes for all failure scenarios:
- `ERR-UNAUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized access attempts
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-TOKENS`: Insufficient token balance
- `ERR-INVALID-PROPOSAL`: Invalid proposal parameters
- `ERR-VOTING-PERIOD-ENDED`: Voting period has ended
- `ERR-ALREADY-VOTED`: Attempt to vote twice
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND`: Proposal doesn't exist
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-ACTIVE`: Proposal is not active
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE`: Insufficient balance for transfer

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### **Creating a Proposal**
```clarity
(create-proposal 
    "Upgrade DAO Treasury" 
    "Proposal to upgrade the DAO treasury management system" 
    "treasury" 
    (some 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM) 
    u10000)
```

### **Voting on a Proposal**
```clarity
(vote-on-proposal u1 true)  ; Vote "for" on proposal #1
```

### **Transferring Tokens**
```clarity
(transfer u100 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM 'ST2NEB84ASENDXKYGJPQW86YXQCEFEX2ZQPG87ND)
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Access Control**: Only token holders can participate in governance
- **Vote Integrity**: Prevents double voting and ensures vote authenticity
- **Quorum Protection**: Prevents low-participation proposals from passing
- **Time-based Security**: Voting periods and execution delays prevent manipulation

## üìä Governance Metrics

The contract tracks comprehensive governance metrics:
- **Member Statistics**: Join date, voting power, proposals created, votes cast
- **Proposal Analytics**: Vote counts, participation rates, quorum achievement
- **DAO Health**: Total supply, treasury balance, active proposals

## üß™ Testing

- ‚úÖ Contract compilation successful
- ‚úÖ All functions properly implemented
- ‚úÖ Error handling comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Data structures optimized
- ‚úÖ Security measures in place

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- **Multi-signature Treasury**: Enhanced treasury management
- **Delegated Voting**: Vote delegation mechanisms
- **Proposal Templates**: Standardized proposal formats
- **Advanced Quorum**: Dynamic quorum calculations
- **Governance Tokens**: Separate governance and utility tokens

## üìù License

This smart contract is part of the DAOForge project and follows Stacks blockchain best practices for DAO governance systems.
